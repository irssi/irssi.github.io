title: "Irssi 0.8.20 Released"
---

Irssi 0.8.20 has been released. This release fixes two remote crash
issues in Irssi 0.8.17 and later. There are no new features. **All
users should upgrade to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#v0-8-20) for
details.

Read the [security advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2016).


This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](/NEWS/#v0-8-20). Binary test packages
for various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are
available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.  This is a possibly incomplete list of distros which have
applied the hotfix to their stable versions instead of updating to
0.8.20:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial): `0.8.19-1ubuntu1.2`
  ([USN-3086-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3086-1/))
- Debian 8 (jessie): `0.8.17-1+deb8u1`
  ([DSA 3672-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2016/msg00251.html))

Note that the version shown by irssi internally is kept the same, but
they are safe to use anyway. The installed version can be verified with
`dpkg -l irssi` in ubuntu and debian.

Those who cannot upgrade right now, but with Perl support enabled in
their Irssi, can load [this](/security/sa_patch.pl) script and add it to
`~/.irssi/scripts/autorun` as a first aid to mitigating these issues.

Furthermore, we are always looking for testers of the development
version. Binaries of the current git development version are
automatically packaged in the
[irssi-git](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-git;package=irssi-git)
repository. The current development source code can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/irssi/irssi). Some more information on the
[Contributing](https://irssi.org/development/) page.  Report
[Issues](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues) and do not hesitate to
send in [Patches](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/pulls)!
