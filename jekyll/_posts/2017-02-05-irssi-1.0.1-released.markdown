title: "Irssi 1.0.1 Released"
---

Irssi 1.0.1 has been released. This release is our first bug fix
release on the 1.0 branch. You won't see new features on 1.0. Most
importantly, a mistake that broke tab completion of settings and
aliases has been corrected, as well as a memory leak during SASL found
by Joseph Bisch. **All users of 1.0.0 should upgrade to this
version**. See the
[NEWS](//raw.githubusercontent.com/irssi/irssi/maint/1.0.1/NEWS) for
details.

This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/releases). Binary test packages
for various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are
available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

It is our hope that distros with long term stability can nevertheless
follow our bug fix releases. Please check with your distro whether
they provide officially updated packages.

The Irssi Team.
