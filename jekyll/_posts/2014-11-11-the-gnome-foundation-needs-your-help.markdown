The [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) foundation [trademark is under
attack](https://www.gnome.org/groupon) by well funded corporate interests.

As a fellow open source project with a vibrant and passionate user and
contributor community, we feel strongly about this issue.

We will not stand by idly while corporate bullies are trying to water down
the value and image  of open-source projects and their communities, create
confusion, and spread FUD.

To this end, our core contributors have [donated 1,000 USD](/images/gnome.png)
to the GNOME Foundation defense fund; we encourage you to do the same!
