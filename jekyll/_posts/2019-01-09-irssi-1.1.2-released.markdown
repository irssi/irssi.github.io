Happy New Year from the Irssi Team!

Irssi 1.1.2 has been released! This release fixes some stability
issues in Irssi 1.1 as well as a few bug fixes. There are no new
features. **All Irssi 1.1 users should upgrade to this version**. See
the [NEWS](/NEWS/#news-v1-1-2) for details.

For more information refer to the [security
advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2019_01).

This release can be downloaded from [our releases page](/NEWS). Binary
test packages for various Linux distributions are automatically
generated by the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/)
and are available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distribution whether they provide officially
updated packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

In the meantime, the following interesting changes happened in the development version of Irssi:

- Syntax for the the /STATUSBAR commands was improved ([#858](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/858))
- Private notices intended for channels are now displayed on the channel (new setting notice_channel_context) ([#959](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/959))
- The "Off-the-record" module was imported into the Irssi tree ([#854](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/854), [#589](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/589), [#196](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/196))
- Users can now choose between different implementations of `wcwidth`. This is used to calculate the width of emojis on your terminal screen ([#917](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/917), [#720](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/720))

  These functions are now also available from Perl ([#973](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/973)):

      string_width(str)
      string_chars_for_width(str, width)
      wcwidth(char)

- Added a completion_keep_word setting ([#979](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/979))

- Add autolog_only_saved_channels setting, to autolog only channels that are in the config ([#968](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/968))
- Prevent config truncation when no space left.
