Happy new year from the Irssi Team!

Irssi 1.0.6 has been released. This release fixes a few security
issues in Irssi as well as a few bugs. There are no new
features. **All Irssi users should upgrade to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#news-v1-0-6) for
details.

Most issues have been identified using fuzzing, thanks to Joseph Bisch.

For more information refer to the [security advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2018_01).

This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](/NEWS/#news-v1-0-6). Binary test packages
for various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are
available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

The Irssi Team.
