title: "Irssi 1.0.5 Released"
---

Irssi 1.0.5 has been released. This release fixes a few security
issues in Irssi as well as a few bugs. There are no new
features. **All Irssi users should upgrade to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#v1-0-5) for
details.

Most issues have been identified using fuzzing, thanks to Hanno Böck
and Joseph Bisch. We expect Joseph will be able to tell you more
about his newest fuzzer at [freenode.live](https://freenode.live/) on the weekend!

For more information refer to the [security advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2017_10).

This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](/NEWS/#v1-0-5). Binary test packages
for various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are
available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

The Irssi Team.
