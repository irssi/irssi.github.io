  <h2>About Irssi</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>Irssi is a modular IRC client for UNIX that currently has only text
  mode user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific, so
  other UIs could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really even
  IRC specific anymore, there's already working
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051016080925/http://www.silcnet.org/">SILC</a> and
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051016080925/http://www.icb.net/">ICB</a> modules available. Support for other
  protocols like ICQ and Jabber could be created some day too.</p>

<h3>Where's the GTK+/GNOME version?</h3>

  <p>This has been asked from me <strong>many</strong> times. There
  <strong>used to be</strong> GTK+/GNOME user interface, but I stopped
  updating it when I was rewriting lots of code. Main reasons for it were
  that lots of people wanted a better text mode UI, but only a few people
  ever gave comments about the GUI version. Though looking at the
  download counters when 0.7.90 was released (first non-GUI version), the
  counter dropped from (in the next 2 days after release) ~1000 to
  ~100.</p>

  <p>The next often asked question is: Am I going to fix the GUI code to
  work again? The old code: not likely, writing a new GUI: yes, I think
  so :) I have a few new great ideas for it already. It isn't fun to make
  something old to work again, especially if it wouldn't be clearly
  better than competing products ;) When the next release of GTK+/GNOME
  Irssi is released, I intend it to be clearly the best GUI client there
  is.</p>

  <p>And what about QT/KDE port, or windows port? Well, I'm probably not
  going to write them at least soon, you go ahead and start them :)
  Windows port might be possible to do with GTK's Win32 port. Or Qt's of
  course.</p>

<h3>But there's already ircII and others..</h3>

  <p>What separates Irssi from ircII, BitchX, epic and the rest text
  clients? The code. I'm not using the crappy ugly kludgy code of ircII.
  Non-developers don't probably care that much about it, but that means a
  few good things anyway:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Security</strong> - I'm quite confident that there's no
  security bugs in Irssi. No buffer overflows, no format bugs (%s%s%s),
  no remote exploits, nothing.</li>

  <li><strong>Modularity</strong> - Irssi is highly extensible, you could
  change almost anything in Irssi with a runtime loadable module. And you
  can probably change anything you actually need to change with a Perl
  script.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>Features</h3>

  <p>So what's so great about Irssi? Here's a list of some features I can
  think of currently:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Optional automation</strong> - There's lots of things Irssi
  does for you automatically that some people like and others just hate.
  Things like: nick completion, creating new window for newly joined
  channel, creating queries when msgs/notices are received or when you
  send a msg, closing queries when it's been idle for some time,
  etc.</li>

  <li><strong>Multiserver friendly</strong> - I think Irssi has clearly
  the best support for handling multiple server connections. You can have
  as many as you want in as many ircnets as you want. Having several
  connections in one server works too, for example when you hit the
  (ircnet's) 10 channels/connection limit you can just create another
  connection and you hardly notice it. If connection to server is lost,
  Irssi tries to connect back until it's successful. Also channels you
  were joined before disconnection are restored, even if they're
  "temporarily unavailable" because of netsplits, Irssi keeps
  rejoining back to them. Also worth noticing - there's not that stupid
  "server is bound to this window, if this window gets closed the
  connection closes" thing that ircII based clients have.</li>

  <li><strong>Channel automation</strong> - You can specify what channels
  to join to immediately after connected to some server or IRC network.
  After joined to channel, Irssi can automatically request ops for you
  (or do anything, actually) from channel's bots.</li>

  <li><strong>Window content saving</strong> - Say /LAYOUT SAVE when you've
  put all the channels and queries to their <strong>correct place</strong>,
  and after restarting Irssi, the channels will be joined back into windows
  where they were saved.</li>

  <li><strong>Tab completing anything</strong> - You can complete lots of
  things with tab: nicks, commands, command -options, file names,
  settings, text format names, channels and server names. There's also an
  excellent /msg completion that works transparently with multiple IRC
  networks. Completing channel nicks is also pretty intelligent, it first
  goes through the people who have talked to you recently, then the
  people who have talked to anyone recently and only then it fallbacks to
  rest of the nicks. You can also complete a set of words you've
  specified, for example homepage&lt;tab&gt; changes it to your actual
  home page URL.</li>

  <li><strong>Excellent logging</strong> - You can log any way you want
  and as easily or hard as you want. With autologging Irssi logs
  everything to specified directory, one file per channel/nick. ircII
  style /WINDOW LOG ON is also supported. There's also the "hard
  way" of logging - /LOG command which lets you specify exactly what
  you wish to log and where. Log rotating is supported with all the
  different logging methods, you can specify how often you want it to
  rotate and what kind of time stamp to use.</li>

  <li><strong>Excellent ignoring</strong> - You can most probably ignore
  anything any way you want. Nick masks, words, regular expressions. You
  can add exceptions to ignores. You can ignore other people's replies in
  channels to nicks you have ignored. You can also specify that the
  specific ignores work only in specific channel(s).</li>

  <li><strong>Lastlog and scrollback handling</strong> - /LASTLOG command
  has some new features: -new option checks only lines that came since
  you last did /LASTLOG command, -away option checks new lines since you
  last went away. Regular expression matches work also, of course. Going
  to some wanted place at scrollback has always been hard with non-GUI
  clients. A search command that jumps around in scrollback in GUI-style
  is still missing from Irssi, but there's something that's almost as
  good as it. /LASTLOG always shows timestamps when the line was printed,
  even if you didn't have timestamps on. Now doing /SB GOTO
  &lt;timestamp&gt; jumps directly to the position in scrollback you
  wanted. Great feature when you want to browse a bit of the discussion
  what happened when someone said your name (as seen in awaylog) or topic
  was changed (/last -topics)</li>

  </ul>

<h3>Source code</h3>

  <p>IMHO, irssi's source code is (mostly) excellent :) Because of it's
  modular design and signals it uses to communicate between (and inside)
  the modules, it's extremely easy to add new features and change
  existing, even in run time by loading modules.</p>
