Irssi 0.8.19 has been released. This is purely a bugfix release addressing
the worst regressions in the 0.8.18 release. There are no new features. 
All packagers are encouraged to package this version. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#v0-8-19) for
details.


This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](/NEWS/#v0-8-19). Binary test packages for
various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
