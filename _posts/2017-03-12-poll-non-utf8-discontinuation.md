title: "Poll: Non-UTF-8 discontinuation"
---

Hello fellow Irssi users,

We are planning to remove 8-bit and Chinese support from Irssi.

Interaction with legacy IRC channels would still be provided through /recode, as it is currently.

However, Irssi would stop working on non-UTF-8 terminals (or at least appear heavily glitched)

If you have any helpful comments or concerns about this topic, please raise your voice either in the [GitHub issue 671](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/671) or by writing an [e-mail](https://github.com/irssi). We're especially interested to learn about people who are still using the 8-bit support and why you would not be able to move to Unicode.

Thank you for your support,

The Irssi Team.
