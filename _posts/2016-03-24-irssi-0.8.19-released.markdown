Irssi 0.8.19 has been released. This is purely a bugfix release addressing
the worst regressions in the 0.8.18 release. There are no new features. 
All packagers are encouraged to package this version. See the
[NEWS](//raw.githubusercontent.com/irssi/irssi/0.8.19/NEWS) for
details.

This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/releases). Binary test packages for
various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are available for
download in the
[irssi-test](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ailin_nemui:/irssi-test/)
repository.

Furthermore, we are always looking for testers of the development version. Binaries
of the current git development version are automatically packaged in the
[irssi-git](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ailin_nemui:/irssi-git/)
repository. The current development source code can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/irssi/irssi). Some more information on the
