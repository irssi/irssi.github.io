The Irssi for Windows installer and portable packages are finally in the
process of being updated for Irssi 0.8.15.

Before the new Windows binaries are released, we'd like some Windows users to
test the 0.8.15 installer in order to prepare it for prime time. If you would
like to help with the test effort, please read [the testing
notes](http://irssi.org/files/irssi_0_8_15_windows_testing.txt) that outline
the testing details, then download the [test
installer](http://www.irssi.org/files/irssi_0_8_15_TEST3.exe).

The Irssi Team would also like to wish you a happy holidays and all the best
for the New Year.
