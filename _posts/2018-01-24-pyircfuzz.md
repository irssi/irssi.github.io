This blog post is a follow up to [my first post on this blog about fuzzing
Irssi](https://irssi.org/2017/05/12/fuzzing-irssi/). This time we will look at
using pyircfuzz instead of afl-fuzz.

First we are going to get pyircfuzz itself and run it. Pyircfuzz acts as an IRC
server, but it sends a variety of messages (not always well formed) to the IRC
client(s) that are connected in an attempt to crash the client(s).

```
git clone https://github.com/josephbisch/pyircfuzz
cd pyircfuzz
python3 ircfuzz.py
```

Next we need to get Irssi and checkout 1.0.2, because we know it actually has
bugs for us to find. Then, after we have built Irssi, we are going to run it
and connect to the pyircfuzz instance on localhost and log the error output to
a file.

```
git clone https://github.com/irssi/irssi
cd irssi
git checkout 1.0.2
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 ./autogen.sh CC=clang CFLAGS="-g -Og -fsanitize=address"
make
./src/fe-text/irssi -c localhost 2> asan.log
```

Here is a picture of what Irssi looks like at this point. It crashed so quickly
(remember we are using an outdated version of Irssi) that I didn't have time to
get a screenshot of the fuzzing in action.

Here is the AddressSanitizer output (from asan.log):

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV /home/joseph/irssi-blog-temp/irssi/src/fe-common/irc/dcc/fe-dcc-get.c:43:2 in dcc_request
==31221==ABORTING
```

In the pyircfuzz directory, there is an ircfuzz.log file. This is a list of all
the IRC messages that the fuzzer sent to the IRC client leading up to the
crash. So it should act as a reproducer. Make sure you rename it if you want to
save it, because running pyircfuzz again will overwrite that file. I already
know from the stacktrace that the crash happened in the DCC code. So I can do
the following to filter out irrelevant lines from the reproducer:

```
grep -a "DCC" ircfuzz.log > ircfuzz-dcc.log
```

Pyircfuzz doesn't currently have a minimizer included, so you either have to
figure out yourself what line(s) cause the crash or use a minimizer from
another fuzzer like afl-tmin. But just greping for the lines with DCC in them
already limits the number of lines to look through (at least in my case).

You can reproduce the crash by doing the following:

```
cat ircfuzz.log | nc -l -p 6667
```

Then in another terminal:

```
./src/fe-text/irssi -c localhost
```

You should see the AddressSanitizer output in the terminal you ran Irssi in if
the bug is indeed reproducible.

### Conclusion

I have found pyircfuzz to be an effective tool for fuzzing IRC clients. It has
found bugs in Irssi that haven't been found other ways (such as with afl-fuzz
or libfuzzer). Part of the reason is the ease of fuzzing the whole client
without modification. That's not to say that afl-fuzz and libfuzzer aren't
capable of finding these bugs if the proper fuzz targets are written, but it is
just so easy to connect to the fuzzer as you would any other IRC server.

I hope you find pyircfuzz useful. As usual, we would like to hear about any
bugs you find, whether by fuzzing or other methods. You can report non-security
bugs via the [Irssi GitHub repo](https://github.com/irssi/irssi). Security bugs
can be reported to Irssi staff. Staff can be reached at staff@irssi.org.

Also, patches to improve pyircfuzz are welcome via the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/josephbisch/pyircfuzz).
