Irssi 1.0.4 has been released. This release fixes two remote crash
issues in Irssi as well as a few bugs, correcting a mistake that
was introduced in 1.0.3 while parsing some time-related
settings. There are no new features. **All Irssi users should upgrade
to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#v1-0-4) for
details.

Thanks, Brian!

This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](/NEWS/#v1-0-4). Binary test packages
for various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are
available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.
