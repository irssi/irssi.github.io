The Irssi team is pleased to announce the 0.8.16 release of Irssi. It has been
quite some time since our last release and there has been [various feature
enhancements and bugfixes added since then](/NEWS/#v0-8-16).


We hope to have Irssi 0.8.17 out in a much shorter time than it took to get
0.8.16 out and there may be some announcements on changes to how contributing
to the project works in the future.

The release can be downloaded from [our download page](/NEWS/#v0-8-16).
