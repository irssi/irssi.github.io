      Bug 1

      The unformat_24bit_color() function is called by format_send_to_gui()
      to decode 24bit color codes into their components. The pointer is
      advanced unconditionally without checking if a complete code was
      supplied.

      Thus, after the return of unformat_24bit_color(), ptr might be invalid
      and point out of the buffer.

      Bug 2

      The format_send_to_gui() function does not validate the length of the
      string before incrementing the `ptr' pointer in all cases.

      If that happens, the pointer `ptr' can be incremented twice and thus
      end past the boundaries of the original `dup' buffer.

description: >
  Gabriel Campana and Adrien Guinet from Quarkslab reported two remote
  crash and heap corruption vulnerabilites in Irssi's format parsing
  code.

  They also provided us with proof of concept exploit code and patches
  to fix those issues.

impact: >
  Remote crash and heap corruption. Remote code execution seems
  difficult since only Nuls are written.

recommended_action: >
  Upgrade to Irssi 0.8.20. Irssi 0.8.20 is a maintenance release
  without any new features.

  After installing the updated packages, one can issue the /upgrade
  command to load the new binary. TLS connections will require
  /reconnect.

  - title: Fallback action
    text: >
      Distributions which need to remain on Irssi 0.8.17 are strongly urged
      to apply the patch and provide updated packages.

      Those who cannot upgrade right now, but with Perl support enabled in
      their Irssi, can load the following script and add it to
      ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun as a first aid to mitigating these issues:
