    description: 'Out of bounds read when parsing incorrectly quoted DCC files'
    description_long: >

      memory. Found by Joseph Bisch. (CWE-129, CWE-127)
    impact: >
      May result in denial of service (remote crash), but in practice
      this seems to be very unlikely unless address sanitizer is
      enabled.
