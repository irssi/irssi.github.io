The Irssi team is pleased to announce the 0.8.15 release of Irssi. It has been
quite some time since our last release and there has been various
feature enhancements and bugfixes added since then.

This release fixes two security issues: The first being that Irssi didn't check
hostname on SSL connections and the other being a hard to exploit remote crash
bug.

For a complete listing of the changes and bugfixes since 0.8.14, please have a
look at the [ChangeLog](/NEWS/#v0-8-15).
