title: "Irssi 1.0.2 Released"
---

Irssi 1.0.2 has been released. This release fixes a remote crash issue
in Irssi 1.0 as well as a few bug fixes, the most notable a regression
that broke incoming DCC file transfers. There are no new
features. **All Irssi 1.0 users should upgrade to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#v1-0-2) for
details.

Furthermore, we need to emphasise that in Irssi 1.0 up to and
including 1.0.2, GRegex is [not UTF-8
compliant](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/636). Enabling UTF-8
in GRegex while receiving arbitrary messages (i.e. invalid UTF-8, as
happens frequently on IRC) would lead to memory issues and crashes,
therefore it is currently operating in byte mode. You can either
choose to revert to your system provided regex engine using
`--disable-gregex` at ./configure time and hope that it does whatever
you need, or join the discussion on issue #636 for how to best solve
this problem, or apply the
[patch](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/pull/653.patch) from PR#653 if
you need proper Unicode-aware regexen in `/hilight` and `/ignore` as
an intermediate solution.

Read the [security advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2017_03).


This release can be downloaded from [our releases
page](/NEWS/#v1-0-2). Binary test packages
for various Linux distributions are automatically generated by the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and are
available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
repository.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

The Irssi Team.
