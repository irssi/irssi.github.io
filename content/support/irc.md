Official international channel
-------------------------------

- \#irssi at [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) -- English only

To join, `/connect Freenode`, then `/join #irssi`

If you have trouble getting Irssi to work, you can use the Freenode
provided [webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=irssi) in
the meantime.

Other channels
--------------

Many other networks like IRCnet, EFNet or QuakeNet also have `#irssi` channels.

There may be some international channels on IRCnet, like

- \#irssi.fi -- Finnish
- \#irssi.de -- German
- \#irssi.pl -- Polish

If you have something to ask, **please JUST ASK instead of asking if you
can ask or if someone can help or if anyone is there**.

Servers
-------

To connect with Freenode, `/connect Freenode` or `/connect chat.freenode.net`

Most IRCnet servers aren't open for everyone, so if you're having trouble
finding one, use open.ircnet.net which resolves to a number of open IRCnet
servers that you should be able to use.

For EFNet, use `irc.efnet.org`, or check their website for more servers.
