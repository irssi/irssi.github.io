Irssi settings notes. Updated for 1.2.2

This is not an attempt to document Irssi completely. It should be used along with the documents at [Documentation](/documentation/) for more complete understanding of how Irssi works. For example, the startup HOWTO and tips/tricks show sample uses for these settings, including some very useful stuff.

See the [appendix](#a_credits) for credits and license information of this document.

##  [completion]

{:#completion_auto}
` completion_auto` **`OFF`**

> Tell Irssi to detect incomplete nicknames in your input and look up their completions automatically. Incomplete nicknames are detected when you input text that matches /^(\S+)${completion_character}/. For example:
>
>>
>>     vis: hello
>
> will be expanded to
>
>>
>>     visitors: hello
>
> when you press enter. So will:
>
>>
>>     vis:hello
>>     Vis::Hello(12);
>
> This will eventually bite you.

{:#completion_char}
` completion_char` **`:`**

> The text that Irssi puts after a tab-completed nickname, or that it uses to detect nicknames when you have completion_auto turned on. Some people alter this to colorize the completion character, creating the oft-dreaded bold colon.

{:#completion_empty_line}
` completion_empty_line` **`ON`**

> When this setting is OFF, tab completion will be disabled when the input line is empty. Disabling it is useful when pasting text that starts with a tab character, since that normally results in a /msg to a recent target.
>
> Added in Irssi 1.0.0

{:#completion_keep_word}
` completion_keep_word` **`ON`**

> Whether to keep the original word that was completed, in the list of completions. This way, you can "undo" accidential completions more easily with Shift-Tab.
>
> Added in Irssi 1.2.0

{:#completion_keep_privates}
` completion_keep_privates` **`10`**

> Irssi keeps a list of nicknames from private messages (sent and received) to search during nick completion. This setting determines how many nicknames are held.

{:#completion_keep_publics}
` completion_keep_publics` **`50`**

> Irssi keeps a list of nicknames from public messages (sent and received) to search during nick completion. This setting determines how many nicknames are held.

{:#completion_nicks_lowercase}
` completion_nicks_lowercase` **`OFF`**

> When enabled, Irssi forces completed nicknames to lowercase. Manually typed nicknames retain their case.

{:#completion_strict}
` completion_strict` **`OFF`**

> When on, nicknames are matched strictly. That is, the partial nickname you enter must be at the beginning of a nickname in one of Irssi's lists.
>
> When off, Irssi will first try a strict match. If a strict match can't be found, Irssi will look for nicknames that match when their leading non-alphanumeric characters are removed. For example:
>
>>
>>     vis: hello
>
> With strict completion on, it will only match nicknames beginning with vis. With strict completion off, it may match visitors or _visitors_ or [visitors], and so on.

{:#completion_nicks_match_case}
` completion_nicks_match_case` **`auto`**

> Whether to enforce the case of the letters you typed while completing nicks. Accepted values:
>
> * `never` - ignore the case of nicks when completing.
> * `always` - nicks are only completed when the case matches.
> * `auto` (default) - as soon as you type an uppercase letter, the nick case has to match.
>
> Added in Irssi 1.0.0

##  [dcc]

{:#dcc_autoaccept_lowports}
` dcc_autoaccept_lowports` **`OFF`**

> When this setting is OFF, Irssi will not auto-accept DCC requests from privileged ports (those below 1024) even when auto-accept is otherwise on.

{:#dcc_autochat_masks}
` dcc_autochat_masks` **` `**

> Set dcc_autochat_masks with user masks to auto-accept chat requests from. When unset, Irssi's auto-accept settings work for everyone who tries to DCC chat you. The drawbacks can range from annoying through downright dangerous. Use auto-accept with care.

{:#dcc_autoget}
` dcc_autoget` **`OFF`**

> Turn DCC auto-get on or off. When on, Irssi will attempt to auto-get files sent to you.
>
> This feature can be abused, so it is usually off by default. If you enable it, consider also setting dcc_autoget_masks and dcc_autoget_max_size to make this feature more secure.

{:#dcc_autoget_masks}
` dcc_autoget_masks` **` `**

> Set dcc_autoget_masks with user masks to automatically accept files sent to you via DCC. When unset, Irssi's auto-get settings will work for everyone who attempts to send you files.
>
> This setting is only significant if dcc_autoget is ON.

{:#dcc_autoget_max_size}
` dcc_autoget_max_size` **`0k`**

> Set to nonzero to limit the size of files that Irssi will auto-get.
>
> Note: Because of the way DCC works, someone may advertise a file at once size but try to send you something larger. According to src/irc/dcc/dcc-autoget.c, this only filters the request based on the advertised size.
>
> This setting is only significant if dcc_autoget is ON.

{:#dcc_autorename}
` dcc_autorename` **`OFF`**

> Turn on this setting to automatically rename received files so they don't overwrite existing files.
>
> I think this setting may thwart dcc_autoresume, since the auto-resume feature looks for existing filenames when resuming. Auto-renaming downloads makes sure that filenames never conflict, so resuming is not possible.

{:#dcc_autoresume}
` dcc_autoresume` **`OFF`**

> When on, dcc_autoresume will cause Irssi to look for existing files with the same name as a new DCC transfer. If a file already exists by that name, Irssi will try to resume the transfer by appending any new data to the existing file.
>
> I think this option clashes with dcc_autorename. See dcc_autorename for more information.
>
> Dcc_autoresume is ignored if dcc_autoget is off.

{:#dcc_download_path}
` dcc_download_path` **`~`**

> The path to a directory where Irssi will store DCC downloads.

{:#dcc_file_create_mode}
` dcc_file_create_mode` **`644`**

> The mode in which new files are created.
>
>> 644 is read/write by you, and readable by everybody else.
>>
>> 600 is read/write by you, nobody else can read or write.

{:#dcc_mirc_ctcp}
` dcc_mirc_ctcp` **`OFF`**

> Tells Irssi to send CTCP messages that are compatible with mIRC clients. This lets you use /me actions in DCC chats with mIRC users, among other things.

{:#dcc_own_ip}
` dcc_own_ip` **` `**

> Set dcc_own_ip to force Irssi to always send DCC requests from a particular virtual host (vhost). Irssi will always bind sockets to this address when answering DCC requests. Otherwise Irssi will determine your IP address on its own.

{:#dcc_port}
` dcc_port` **`0`**

> The smallest port number that Irssi will use when initiating DCC requests. Irssi picks a port at random when this is set to zero.
>
> dcc_port can be two ports, separated by a space. In that case, Irssi will pick a port between the two numbers, inclusively. For example:
>
>>
>>     /set dcc_port 10000 20000

{:#dcc_send_replace_space_with_underscore}
` dcc_send_replace_space_with_underscore` **`OFF`**

> When enabled, Irssi will replace spaces with underscores in the names of files you send. It should only be necessary when sending files to clients that don't support quoted filenames, or if you hate spaces in filenames.

{:#dcc_timeout}
` dcc_timeout` **`5min`**

> How long to keep track of pending DCC requests. Requests that do not receive responses within this time will be automatically canceled.

{:#dcc_upload_path}
` dcc_upload_path` **`~`**

> The path where you keep public files available to send via DCC.

##  [flood]

{:#autoignore_time}
` autoignore_time` **`5min`**

> Irssi can auto-ignore people who are flooding. autoignore_time sets the amount of time to keep someone ignored. Irssi will automatically unignore them after this period of time has elapsed.

{:#autoignore_level}
` autoignore_level` **` `**

> The type or types of messages that will trigger auto-ignore.

{:#flood_max_msgs}
` flood_max_msgs` **`4`**

{:#flood_timecheck}
` flood_timecheck` **`8`**

> Irssi will treat text as flooding if more than flood_max_msgs messages are received during flood_timecheck seconds. In the case above, five or more messages matching autoignore_level over the course of eight seconds will trigger flood protection. See autoignore_time to set the amount of time someone will remain ignored if it's determined that they're flooding.

{:#cmds_max_at_once}
` cmds_max_at_once` **`5`**

> How many commands you can send immediately before server-side flood protection starts.
>
> IRC servers also perform flood checking, and they will gleefully disconnect you if you are abusing them. The cmds_max_at_once setting lets Irssi know how many rapid messages it can get away with while remaining under the IRC server's radar.

{:#cmd_queue_speed}
` cmd_queue_speed` **`2200msec`**

> The time to wait between sending commands to an IRC server. Used to prevent Irssi from flooding you off if you must auto-kick/ban lots of people at once.

{:#max_ctcp_queue}
` max_ctcp_queue` **`5`**

> The maximum number of pending CTCP requests to keep. Requests beyond max_ctcp_queue will be discarded.

##  [history]

{:#max_command_history}
` max_command_history` **`100`**

> The number of lines of your own input to keep for recall.

{:#rawlog_lines}
` rawlog_lines` **`200`**

> Irssi's raw log is a buffer of raw IRC messages. It's used for debugging Irssi and maybe some other things. This setting tells Irssi how many raw messages to keep around.

{:#scroll_page_count}
` scroll_page_count` **`/2`**

> How many pages to scroll the scrollback buffer when pressing page-up or page-down. Expressed as a number of lines, or as a fraction of the screen:
>
>>
>>     /2  = Scroll half a page.
>>     .33 = Scroll about a third of a page.
>>     4   = Scroll four lines.

{:#scrollback_burst_remove}
` scrollback_burst_remove` **`10`**

> This is a speed optimization: Don't bother removing messages from the scrollback buffer until the line limit has been exceeded by scrollback_burst_remove lines. This lets Irssi do its memory management in chunks rather than one line at a time.

{:#scrollback_lines}
` scrollback_lines` **`500`**

> The maximum number of messages to keep in your scrollback history. Set to 0 if you don't want to limit scrollback by a line count. The scrollback_time setting will be used even if scrollback_lines is zero.
>
> Setting scrollback_lines to zero also seems to thwart the scrollback_burst_remove optimization.

{:#scrollback_time}
` scrollback_time` **`1day`**

> Keep at least scrollback_time worth of messages in the scrollback buffer, even if it means having more than scrollback_lines lines in the buffer.
> Valid formats for the setting are:
>
>>     day/hour/minute/min/second/sec/millisecond/millisec/msecond/msec
>
> and the plural forms of the above: days, hours etc
>
> The maximum value for days is 24

{:#scrollback_max_age}
` scrollback_max_age` **`0`**

> Delete messages older than the given time in each scrollback buffer. The given time has the same format as the scrollback_time setting. Note: messages can only be deleted when there is activity in a buffer. Thus, "day changed" messages will trigger deletion in inactive buffers.
>
> Currently, the oldest time you can set is 24days.
>
> Added in Irssi 1.3

{:#window_history}
` window_history` **`OFF`**

> When turned ON, command history will be kept per-window. When off, Irssi uses a single command history for all windows.

##  [log]

{:#autolog}
` autolog` **`OFF`**

> Automatically log everything, or at least the types of messages defined by autolog_level.

{:#autolog_colors}
` autolog_colors` **`OFF`**

> Whether to save colors in autologs. Colors make logs harder to parse and grep, but they may be vital for channels that deal heavily in ANSI art, or something.

{:#autolog_ignore_targets}
` autolog_ignore_targets` **` `**

> A space separated list of targets to exclude from autologging
>
> See `activity_hide_targets` for additional ways to specify targets in Irssi 1.0.0+.
>
> Added in Irssi 0.8.13

{:#autolog_level}
` autolog_level` **`all -crap -clientcrap -ctcps`**

> The types of messages to auto-log. See the autolog setting.

{:#autolog_path}
` autolog_path` **`~/irclogs/$tag/$0.log`**

> The path where autolog saves logs.
>
> $0 is the target (channel or query name usually)
> $1 is the server tag (same as $tag)
>
> See Appendix B for Irssi's special variables. Irssi's special variables can be used to do fancy things like daily log rotations.

{:#autolog_only_saved_channels}
` autolog_only_saved_channels` **`OFF`**

> Only autolog channels that are added in /channel list
>
> Added in Irssi 1.2.0

{:#awaylog_colors}
` awaylog_colors` **`ON`**

> Whether to store color information in /away logs.

{:#awaylog_file}
` awaylog_file` **`~/.irssi/away.log`**

> Where to log messages while you're away.
>
> I assume Irssi's special variables also work here. See Appendix B for more information about them.

{:#awaylog_level}
` awaylog_level` **`msgs hilight`**

> The types of messages to log to awaylog_file while you're away.

{:#log_close_string}
` log_close_string` **`--- Log closed %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y`**

> The message to log when logs are closed.
>
> See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.

{:#log_create_mode}
` log_create_mode` **`600`**

> The permissions to use when creating log files.
>
> 600 is read/write by you, but nobody else can see them. A sensible default mode. It can also be set to 644 if you want the rest of the world to read your logs.

{:#log_day_changed}
` log_day_changed` **`--- Day changed %a %b %d %Y`**

> The message to log when a new day begins.
>
> See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.

{:#log_open_string}
` log_open_string` **`--- Log opened %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y`**

> The message to log when a log is opened.
>
> See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.

{:#log_theme}
` log_theme` **` `**

> Logs can have a different theme than what you see on the screen. This can be used to create machine-parseable versions of logs, for example.

{:#log_timestamp}
` log_timestamp` **`%H:%M `**

> The time format for log timestamps.
>
> See Appendix C for the meanings of Irssi's time format codes.

##  [lookandfeel]

{:#active_window_ignore_refnum}
` active_window_ignore_refnum` **`ON`**

> When set ON, the active_window key (meta-a by default) switches to the window with the highest activity level that was last activated.
>
> When set OFF, the pre-0.8.15 behavior is used: it switches to the window with the highest activity level with the lowest refnum.
>
> Added in Irssi 0.8.15

{:#activity_hide_level}
` activity_hide_level` **` `**

> Message levels that don't count towards channel activity. That is, channels won't be marked as active if messages of these types appear.

{:#activity_hide_targets}
` activity_hide_targets` **` `**

> Sometimes you don't care at all about a window's activity. This can be set to a space separated list of windows that will never appear to be active.

{:#activity_hilight_level}
` activity_hilight_level` **`MSGS DCCMSGS`**

> There are times when you want to highlight channel activity in a window. Like when someone sends you a private message, or a DCC message. Activity_highlight_level sets the kind of messages you think are extra important.

{:#activity_msg_level}
` activity_msg_level` **`PUBLIC`**

> Flag a channel as active when messages of this type are displayed there.

{:#activity_hide_window_hidelevel}
` activity_hide_window_hidelevel` **`ON`**

> Do not flag a window as active if the message is hidden with /window hidelevel
>
> Added in Irssi 1.2.0

{:#activity_hide_visible}
` activity_hide_visible` **`ON`**

> Whether to hide the active flag when the window is visible.
>
> Added in Irssi 1.2.0

{:#actlist_names}
` actlist_names` **`OFF`**

> Turn on to add active items names in 'act' statusbar item.

{:#actlist_prefer_window_name}
` actlist_prefer_window_name` **`OFF`**

> Whether to show the window name instead of the item name when actlist_names is enabled.
>
> Added in Irssi 1.3

{:#actlist_sort}
` actlist_sort` **`refnum`**

> Specifies the sorting type used for the activity bar. Accepted values:
>
> * `refnum` (default) - windows are listed in numeric order
> * `recent` - windows with more recent activity appear first
> * `level` - sort by window level (hilight, msg, etc), same ordering used by active_window command. Windows with the same level are sorted by refnum.
> * `level,recent` - same as level, but windows with the same level are sorted by recent.
>
> Added in Irssi 0.8.12. Before Irssi 0.8.12, a boolean `actlist_moves` setting existed, which was equivalent to setting actlist_sort to refnum.

{:#autoclose_query}
` autoclose_query` **`0`**

> Automatically close query windows after autoclose_query seconds of inactivity. Setting autoclose_query to zero will keep them open until you decide to close them yourself.

{:#autoclose_windows}
` autoclose_windows` **`ON`**

> Automatically close windows when nobody is in them. This keeps your window list tidy, but it means that query windows may rearrange as people log off then privately message you later.

{:#autocreate_own_query}
` autocreate_own_query` **`ON`**

> Turn on to automatically create query windows when you /msg someone.

{:#autocreate_query_level}
` autocreate_query_level` **`MSGS DCCMSGS`**

> Automatically create query windows when receiving these types of messages.

{:#autocreate_windows}
` autocreate_windows` **`ON`**

> When on, create new windows for certain operations, such as /join. When off, everything is just dumped into one window.

{:#autocreate_split_windows}
` autocreate_split_windows` **`OFF`**

> Automatically created windows will be created as split windows with this setting on.
>
> Split windows are the kind where multiple windows are on one screen.

{:#autofocus_new_items}
` autofocus_new_items` **`ON`**

> Switch the focus to a new item when it's created. This may be disturbing at first when combined with query window auto-creation, and it may be downright dangerous if it causes you to accidentally misdirect messages.

{:#autostick_split_windows}
` autostick_split_windows` **`OFF`**

> Whether creating split windows (or showing windows) will automatically stick them to the split window (/window stick on)
>
> The default was changed to `OFF` in Irssi 1.2.0

{:#autounstick_windows}
` autounstick_windows` **`ON`**

> Whether windows should automatically unstick when you try to /window show or /window hide them
>
> Added in Irssi 1.2.0

{:#beep_msg_level}
` beep_msg_level` **` `**

> Beep when messages match this level mask.

{:#beep_when_away}
` beep_when_away` **`ON`**

> Should beeps be noisy when you're /away? Great for people who sleep near their terminals or keep Irssi running at work. :)

{:#beep_when_window_active}
` beep_when_window_active` **`ON`**

> Should beeps be noisy in a window you're watching? Perhaps not, since you are theoretically watching that window. You ARE watching it, aren't you?

{:#bell_beeps}
` bell_beeps` **`OFF`**

> Removed in Irssi 1.0.0.
>
> Tell Irssi whether bell characters (chr 7, ^G) included inside IRC messages should actually cause beeps. This doesn't mean that highlights will make a beep sound, this means that anyone in any irc channel can cause unexplained beeps.
>
> Since its only purpose is to be annoying, we decided to remove this. [See this issue for details](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/524).
>
> Any guide that recommended enabling this to make beeps work is wrong. This setting is not needed for that.

{:#break_wide}
` break_wide` **`OFF`**

> When on, wide characters (fullwidth / CJK / east asian) are always considered line breaking points then wrapping lines for display, instead of only wrapping on space characters.
>
> Example:
>
> ```ascidia

>
> Added in Irssi 1.1.0

{:#chanmode_expando_strip}
` chanmode_expando_strip` **`OFF`**

> When on, $M will not return mode parameters.
>
> This means for example that the channel limit and channel key won't be shown in your statusbar (a common place where $M is used) (but also not in all other places that refer to $M for whatever reason).

{:#colors}
` colors` **`ON`**

> Enable or disable colors.

{:#emphasis}
` emphasis` **`ON`**

> Enable or disable real underlining and bolding when someone says `*bold*` or `_underlined_`.

{:#emphasis_italics}
` emphasis_italics` **`OFF`**

> Enable or disable applying real italics when someone says `/italics/`.
>
> Note: not all terminals support this. Most notably, if the TERM environment variable is set to screen, it won't work.
>
> Added in Irssi 0.8.17

{:#emphasis_multiword}
` emphasis_multiword` **`OFF`**

> Turn on to allow `*more than one word bold*` and `_multiple underlined words_`. Used in conjunction with the emphasis setting.

{:#emphasis_replace}
` emphasis_replace` **`OFF`**

> If emphasis is turned on, the `*` or `_` characters indicating emphasis will be removed when the word is made bold or underlined. Some people find this looks cleaner.
>
> See the emphasis setting for more information.

{:#expand_escapes}
` expand_escapes` **`OFF`**

> Detect escapes in input, and expand them to the characters they describe. For example
>
>>
>>     \t
>
> Is literally '\\' and 't' when expand_escapes is off, but it's the tab character (chr 9) when expand_escapes is on.

{:#hide_colors}
` hide_colors` **`OFF`**

> Hide mIRC and ANSI colors when turned on. This can be used to eliminate angry fruit salad syndrome in some channels.

{:#hide_server_tags}
` hide_server_tags` **`OFF`**

> Server tags are prefixes to some messages (server messages?) that let you know which server the message came from. They're often considered noisy, so this option lets you hide them.

>> half-op `%`
>>
>> op `@`

{:#show_nickmode_empty}

>
> Setting it to very low values may result in issues such as partial key combos getting processed accidentally. 1000 or 500 might be good starting points

{:#massjoin_max_wait}
` massjoin_max_wait` **`5000`**

> The amount of time to watch for mass-joins, in seconds.
>
> 5000 is probably a bit too much.

{:#max_wildcard_modes}
` max_wildcard_modes` **`6`**

>
> It's useful for quoting e-mail or other large-text messages, but it will probably bite you if you try to pasted indented text, such as code listings. Irssi will join multiple lines of code, destroying any structure you wanted to preserve.
>
> Added in Irssi 0.8.10

{:#paste_use_bracketed_mode}
` paste_use_bracketed_mode` **`OFF`**

> Enables bracketed paste mode, which is an alternative to the time-based paste detection.
>
> If supported by the terminal, it's much more reliable since Irssi knows exactly where and when a paste starts and ends, because the terminal sends special control sequences (the "brackets") indicating those positions.
>
> To take full advantage of this feature, time-based paste detection should be disabled by setting `paste_detect_time` to 0.

##  Appendix A: Levels 
{:#a_a}

Levels are categories of messages that can be ignored or otherwise matched. Categories may be combined. For example, you may want to ignore only private messages (MSG) from someone, or you might really hate them and ignore MSGS and PUBLIC. Or even ALL.

See /help levels for a better, probably more current explanation of the different kinds of levels Irssi supports. Meanwhile:

| Level           | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

##  Appendix B: Special Variables and Expandos 
{:#a_b}

Several settings allow special variables. These variables will be replaced by the text they represent at the time they're used. Not at the time you set the setting!

They are mostly used for formatting text in themes.

From <https://irssi.org/documentation/special_vars/>:


NOTE: This is just a slightly modified file taken from EPIC's help.

### Special Variables and Expandos

Irssi supports a number of reserved, dynamic variables, sometimes
referred to as expandos.  They are special in that the client is
constantly updating their values automatically.  There are also
numerous variable modifiers available.

| Modifier          | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| $variable         | A normal variable, expanding to the first match of: <br>  1) an internal SET variable <br> 2) an environment variable |
| $[num]variable    | Expands to the variables value, with 'num' width. <br> If the number is negative, the value is right-aligned. <br> The value is padded to meet the width with the character given after number (default is space). <br> The value is truncated to specified width unless '!' character precedes the number. <br> If '.' character precedes the number the value isn't padded, just truncated. |
| $#variable        | Expands to the number of words in $variable. If $variable is omitted, it assumes $* |
| $@variable        | Expands to the number of characters in $variable. if $variable is omitted, it assumes $* |
| $($subvariable)   | This is somewhat similar to a pointer, in that the value of $subvar is taken as the name of the variable to expand to.  Nesting is allowed. |
| ${expression}     | Permits the value to be embedded in another string unambiguously. |
| $!history!        | Expands to a matching entry in the client's command history, wildcards allowed. |
{: .table }

Whenever an alias is called, these expandos are set to the arguments
passed to it.  If none of these expandos are used in the alias, or
the $() form shown above, any arguments passed will automatically be
appended to the last command in the alias.

| Expando | Description                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| $*      | expands to all arguments passed to an alias               |
| $n      | expands to argument 'n' passed to an alias (counting from zero) |
| $n-m    | expands to arguments 'n' through 'm' passed to an alias   |
| $n-     | expands to all arguments from 'n' on passed to an alias   |
| $-m     | expands to all arguments up to 'm' passed to an alias     |
| $~      | expands to the last argument passed to an alias           |
{: .table }

These variables are set and updated dynamically by the client.  The
case of $A .. $Z is important.

| Variable | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| $,       | last person who sent you a MSG                           |
| $.       | last person to whom you sent a MSG                       |
| $:       | last person to join a channel you are on                 |
| $;       | last person to send a public message to a channel you are on |
| $A       | text of your AWAY message, if any                        |
| $B       | body of last MSG you sent                                |
| $C       | current channel                                          |

| $O       | value of STATUS_OPER if you are an irc operator          |
| $P       | if you are a channel operator in $C, expands to a '@'    |
|          |                                                          |

| $X       | your /userhost $N address (user@host)                    |
| $Y       | value of REALNAME                                        |
| $Z       | time of day (hh:mm, can be changed with /SET timestamp_format) |
| $$       | a literal '$'                                            |
|          |                                                          |
| $versiontime      | prints time of the Irssi version in HHMM format |
| $sysname          | system name (eg. Linux)                         |
| $sysrelease       | system release (eg. 2.2.18)                     |
| $sysarch          | system architecture (eg. i686)                  |
| $topic            | channel topic                                   |
| $usermode         | user mode                                       |
| $cumode           | own channel user mode                           |
| $cumode_space     | like $cumode, but gives space if there's no mode. |
| $tag              | server tag                                      |
| $chatnet          | chat network of server                          |
| $winref           | window reference number                         |

| $itemname         | like $T, but use item's visible_name which may be different <br> (eg. $T = !12345chan, $itemname = !chan) |
{: .table }

For example, assume you have the following alias:

    /alias blah msg $D Hi there!

If /blah is passed any arguments, they will automatically be appended
to the MSG text.  For example:

    /blah oops                    /* command as entered */
    Hi there! oops                /* text sent to $D */

Another useful form is ${}.  In general, variables can be embedded
inside strings without problems, assuming the surrounding text could
not be misinterpreted as part of the variable name.  This form
guarantees that surrounding text will not affect the expression's
return value.

    /eval echo foo$Nfoo             /* breaks, looks for $nfoo */
    /eval echo foo${N}foo           /* ${N} returns current nickname */
    fooYourNickfoo                  /* returned by above command */

##  Appendix C: Time Formats 
{:#a_c}

Messages that describe times are formatted according to the strftime() function in C. According to FreeBSD's strftime() man page, parts of the format represented with % and a letter code are expanded in the following ways.

| Format | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| %A     | is replaced by national representation of the full weekday name. |
| %a     | is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated weekday name. |
| %B     | is replaced by national representation of the full month name. |
| %b     | is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated month name. |
| %C     | is replaced by (year / 100) as decimal number; single digits are preceded by a zero. |
| %c     | is replaced by national representation of time and date. |
| %D     | is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''. |
| %d     | is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31). |
| %E* %O* | POSIX locale extensions.  The sequences %Ec %EC %Ex %EX %Ey %EY %Od %Oe %OH %OI %Om %OM %OS %Ou %OU %OV %Ow %OW %Oy are supposed to provide alternate representations. <br> Additionly %OB implemented to represent alternative months names (used standalone, without day mentioned). |
| %e     | is replaced by the day of month as a decimal number (1-31); single digits are preceded by a blank. |
| %F     | is equivalent to ``%Y-%m-%d''. |
| %G     | is replaced by a year as a decimal number with century.  This year is the one that contains the greater part of the week (Monday as the first day of the week). |
| %g     | is replaced by the same year as in ``%G'', but as a decimal number without century (00-99). |
| %H     | is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23). |
| %h     | the same as %b. |
| %I     | is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (01-12). |
| %j     | is replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366). |
| %k     | is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0-23); single digits are preceded by a blank. |
| %l     | is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1-12); single digits are preceded by a blank. |
| %M     | is replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59). |
| %m     | is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12). |
| %n     | is replaced by a newline. |
| %O*    | the same as %E*. |
| %p     | is replaced by national representation of either ante meridiem or post meridiem as appropriate. |
| %R     | is equivalent to ``%H:%M''. |
| %r     | is equivalent to ``%I:%M:%S %p''. |
| %S     | is replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-60). |
| %s     | is replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC (see mktime(3)). |
| %T     | is equivalent to ``%H:%M:%S''. |
| %t     | is replaced by a tab. |
| %U     | is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53). |
| %u     | is replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (1-7). |
| %V     | is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (01-53).  If the week containing January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1. |
| %v     | is equivalent to ``%e-%b-%Y''. |
| %W     | is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53). |
| %w     | is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (0-6). |
| %X     | is replaced by national representation of the time. |
| %x     | is replaced by national representation of the date. |
| %Y     | is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number. |
| %y     | is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number (00-99). |
| %Z     | is replaced by the time zone name. |
| %z     | is replaced by the time zone offset from UTC; a leading plus sign stands for east of UTC, a minus sign for west of UTC, hours and minutes follow with two digits each and no delimiter between them (common form for RFC 822 date headers). |
| %+     | is replaced by national representation of the date and time (the format is similar to that produced by date(1)). |
| %%     | is replaced by `%'. |

##  Appendix D: Color Codes 
{:#a_d}

Irssi defines codes to represent colors. They work like the `strftime()` codes in Appendix C.

From <https://irssi.org/documentation/formats/>:

Irssi's colors that you can use in text formats, hilights, etc. :

|      |      |      | text     | text         | background |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- |
|  %k  |  %K  |  %0  | black    | dark grey    | black      |
|  %r  |  %R  |  %1  | red      | bold red     | red        |
|  %g  |  %G  |  %2  | green    | bold green   | green      |
|  %y  |  %Y  |  %3  | yellow   | bold yellow  | yellow     |
|  %b  |  %B  |  %4  | blue     | bold blue    | blue       |
|  %m  |  %M  |  %5  | magenta  | bold magenta | magenta    |
|  %p  |  %P  |      | magenta  | (think: purple) |         |
|  %c  |  %C  |  %6  | cyan     | bold cyan    | cyan       |
|  %w  |  %W  |  %7  | white    | bold white   | white      |
{: .table }

|      |      |      |                                      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
|  %n  |  %N  |      | Changes the color to default color, removing all other coloring and formatting. %N is always the terminal's default color. %n is usually too, except in themes it changes to previous color, ie. hello = %Rhello%n and %G{hello} world would print hello in red, and %n would turn back into %G making world green. |
|  %F  |      |      | Blinking on/off (think: flash)       |
|  %U  |      |      | Underline on/off                     |
|  %8  |      |      | Reverse on/off                       |
|  %9  |  %_  |      | Bold on/off                          |
|  %I  |      |      | Italic on/off                        |
|  %:  |      |      | Insert newline                       |
|  %\| |      |      | Marks the indentation position       |
|  %#  |      |      | Monospace font on/off (useful with lists and GUI) |
|  %%  |      |      | A single %                           |
|  %XAB |     |  %xAB | Color from extended plane (A=1-7, B=0-Z) |
|  %ZAABBCC | |  %zAABBCC | HTML color (in hex notation)    |
{: .table }

In .theme files %n works a bit differently. See default.theme for more
information.
